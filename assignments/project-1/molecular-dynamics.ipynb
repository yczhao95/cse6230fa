In side of $2r$, then the overlapping particles start pushing each other apart.\n",

    "For this assignment, I tried 3 main optimizations\n",
    "    a. Utilized openMP to let different threads calulate the force seperately\n",
    "    on their private vectors and then joining them in a critical block.\n",
    "    However, the improvements of runtime is not very significant, and even 5%\n",
    "    slower when the problem size is small and the overhead of multithreading\n",
    "    slows down the calculation. Another possible reason that the \n",
    "    improvement is small is due to that calculating the force for each\n",
    "    pair only takes a fraction of the total computation, a lot of other works\n",
    "    is done on preparing the pairs.Henceforth, this optimization is not adopted\n",
    "    in the final version.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. Adjusted the number of boxes per dimension. Here, I used the box with the\n",
    "    same diameter with the particle effective sphere, to maximize the number of \n",
    "    boxes we can utilize, this reduces in upto 20% of runtime reduction on the \n",
    "    last benchmark. Choosing the right size of boxes is important because, if \n",
    "    the box is too big, then it is not effective enough, and when it is too small,\n",
    "    it could be smaller than the radius and our assumption will not hold, and too\n",
    "    many boxes will make the precalculation slower.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c.Adjusted the layout of vectors into array of structures. This results in a \n",
    "    very minor improvements on all scales of bencmarks, about 10ms. The possible\n",
    "    reason for this is that in this case, structure of arrays is not cache \n",
    "    friendly.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Two further imporvements could be made, one is to estimate the maximum step one\n",
    "particle can travel for a given step increment, and when calculating the bins, we only\n",
    "need to recalculate those particles that falls in that maximum distance to\n",
    "the boundary of its box.\n",
    "Same goes for calculating pairs, if we find that two particles distance is smaller\n",
    "than  the interact_diameter - maximum_step, they are still going to be a pair\n",
    "and we do not need to calculate their boxing and pairing anymore.\n",
